# SIMCA-Q Python Scripting Guide

This guide provides examples on how to use Python to develope SIMCA-Q applications.

At present, Python only can interact with the SIMCA-Q COM interface. Therefore, these apps will only work on Windows systems.

This repo also contains a *requirements.txt* that list all packages used in the examples. To install them, ideally within a virtual environment, run:
```
python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
```
